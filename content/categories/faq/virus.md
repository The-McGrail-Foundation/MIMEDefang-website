Many viruses forge the senderâ€™s address. By default, MIMEDefang does *not* send notifications to virus senders for this very reason.  
We strongly recommend to MIMEDefang administrators that they do not change this behaviour.

However, some MIMEDefang administrators insist on sending notifications to the apparent sender of a virus.  
This is bad behaviour, but we *cannot* control it. Complain to the ISP in question, or blacklist it until it fixes the configuration.
