MIMEDefang is a framework for filtering e-mail. It uses Sendmail’s “Milter” API, some C glue code, and some Perl code to let you write high-performance mail filters in Perl.

People use MIMEDefang to:

-   Block viruses
-   Block or tag spam
-   Remove HTML mail parts
-   Add boilerplate disclaimers to outgoing mail
-   Remove or alter attachments
-   Replace attachments with URL’s
-   Implement sophisticated access controls.

You’re limited only by your imagination. If you can think of it and code it in Perl, you can do it with MIMEDefang.

A complete description of MIMEDefang may be found in the PDF [presentation slides](https://mimedefang.org/static/mimedefang-mcgrail.pdf).
