Many people see e-mails with the following header:

    X-Scanned-By: MIMEDefang x.y
        (www dot mimedefang dot org slash enduser)

That does *not* mean that Mimedefang administrators are in any way associated with the e-mail.  
It simply means that your ISP, or the ISP of the sender, is using the [MIMEDefang](https://mimedefang.org) mail scanner to scan for viruses.
